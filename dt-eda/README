TITLE
Decision-Tree Estimation of Distribution Algorithm in C++

DESCRIPTION
This program implements an estimation of distribution algorithm 
with decision tree probabilistic models. The algorithm does not
assume that solutions are binary strings, every string position
can obtain any number of values, wich is specified by the user.

For references and more information on estimation of distribution 
algorithms or decision tree models, please see the MEDAL report 
published with this code at http://medal.cs.umsl.edu/files/2006010.pdf

All user-defined functions are located in obj-function.cpp, which defines
the objective function, the function to set the numbers of values in 
different string positions, and the function to verify optimality.
