This program implements an estimation of distribution algorithm with dependency tree probabilistic models. The algorithm does not assume that solutions are binary strings, every string position can obtain any number of values, wich is specified by the user.

For references and more information on estimation of distribution algorithms or dependency tree models, please see the MEDAL report published with this code at \href{http://medal.cs.umsl.edu/files/2006010.pdf}\tt{http://medal.cs.umsl.edu/files/2006010.pdf}

All user-defined functions are located in \hyperlink{obj-function_8cpp}{obj-function.cpp}, which defines the objective function, the function to set the numbers of values in different string positions, and the function to verify optimality.
